# Inside The Neutron: Extracting Neutron Form-Factors in Deuteron Electrodisintegration Processes

We investigate the extraction of neutron form-factors in high Q<sup>2</sup> exclusive deuteron electrodisintegration processes to understand the internal structure of the neutron. Form-Factors are a quantitative value that describes the distribution of charge (G<sub>E</sub>) and magnetization (G<sub>M</sub>) within the neutron and also aids in understanding the quark-gluon composition. We investigate kinematics that minimize nuclear effects to obtain precise measurements.

## Reaction

The main concern when trying to extract the neutron form-factors is the lack of a free neutron target. To reliably isolate the neutron contribution, scattering from atomic nuclei is required.

We compute the kinematics of the following quasi-elastic scattering process:

An electron beam hits a stationary deuteron (deuterium nucleus) target and results in a scattered electron, a knock-out nucleon, and recoil nucleon. We investigate the process of the detected knock-out nucleon being the neutron and the recoil nucleon being the proton.

## Re-scatterings

We consider three main contributions when analyzing the reaction's cross-section (production rate or probability of a specific interaction occurring):

`Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA)` The incoming particle is assumed to be a plane wave, meaning its wave function is uniform in space and only varies in time and direction. This assumption simplifies the description of the incoming wave as it doesn't account for any potential distortions or interactions with the medium before the scattering event.
This also assumes that the interaction between the incoming particle and the deuteron is localized, meaning that the nucleus is treated as if it is made of individual nucleons, each of which interacts independently with the incoming particle. The nucleus is seen as a collection of 'free nucleons', with no other nuclear effects taken into account during the scattering process.

`Final State Interaction (FSI)` refers to the interactions that occur between the particles in the final state of a scattering process after the initial interaction has taken place. After the electron interacts with the deuteron, the proton and neutron in the final state may still interact with each other.

`Charge Exchange` refers to the re-scattering process in the final state where there is a transfer of charge between the proton and neutron. Whilst the cause is still unknown, this results in the proton becoming a neutron, and the neutron becoming a proton which can heavily affect the cross-section.
